# aeolus
is a sample pressure app that logs and computes pressure change at intervals useful for atmospheric modelling applications.
The latest version of this app is designed for android devices running API 17 (Jelly Bean) to API 28 (Pie). This represents approximately 98.1% of android devices.

This app performs the following functions:
  - Displays real-time pressure measurements from the phone's barometer.
  - Plots pressure and pressure change.
  - Provides table logs of pressure and pressure change observations.

The primary purpose of this app is to demonstrate how to collect and compute estimates of 
pressure change at regular intervals. Regular frequent pressure collection is essential for estimating pressure change 
at intervals useful for assimilating meteorological observations into weather models.
